## More than just a game

Swift Space Battle is also part of a scientific research project: Analytical geometry through games.

The project had the objective of study and apply analytical geometry (and math, in general) on game development.

It's a different way to learn concepts in this field of study. You can check this [wiki page][wiki] to see for yourself and learn analytical geometry in an interesting way.

There is also a portuguese pdf made at the end of the scientific research project, check it out [here](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Swift-Space-Battle/blob/master/wiki/A%20geometria%20anal%C3%ADtica%20no%20jogo%20Swift%20Space%20Battle.pdf).
