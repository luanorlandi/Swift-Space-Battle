# Contributing to Swift Space Battle

Thanks for taking your time to contribute in this game! :+1:

The game development it's using [MOAI engine][moai] and [Lua][lua] language.

Check the [issues tab][issues] to look for improvements reported.

Feel free to report one or just work on something not listed.

# Setup your development

If you would like to run the game locally, you will need to setup your environment.

Don't worry on installation of tools, their installation are automated in a single tool.

Follow this guide to download and read a simple documentation: [MoaiCLI][moaicli].

Note that the command `moaicli` will be available when exporting the executable, which will depend on your Operating System (have a look here for [Windows][export windows] and [Linux][export linux])

When you run your first build this will download and setup all the tools required.

To run the HTML version you will also need [Node.js][nodejs], this one is for running your game through a HTTPS page.

After installing the tools and building the debug version of the game for HTML, run this command:

```
node distribute/html/html-debug/app.js
```

Note that the page will have a default design, generated by MoaiCLI.

You can download the web files in [gh-pages] to see the same page as in https://luanorlandi.github.io/Swift-Space-Battle/.
